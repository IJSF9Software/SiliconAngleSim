# Set ROOT path and try to autodetect it from ENV
set(ROOTSYS $ENV{ROOTSYS} CACHE STRING "ROOT path")

# You need to tell CMake where to find the ROOT installation. This can be done in a number of ways:
#   - ROOT built with classic configure/make use the provided $ROOTSYS/etc/cmake/FindROOT.cmake
#   - ROOT built with CMake. Add in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH the installation prefix for ROOT
list(APPEND CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH ${ROOTSYS})

#---Locate the ROOT package and defines a number of variables (e.g. ROOT_INCLUDE_DIRS)
find_package(ROOT REQUIRED)

#---Define useful ROOT functions and macros (e.g. ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY)
